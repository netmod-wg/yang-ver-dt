    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>This document defines and describes the YANG <xref target="RFC7950"/>
      constructs that are used to define and use YANG packages.</t>

      <t>A YANG package is a versioned organizational structure used to manage
	  a set of YANG modules that collectively define a package schema. For
      example, a YANG package could contain the set of YANG modules required to
      implement an L2VPN service on a network device.</t>

      <t>Non-normative examples of YANG packages are provided in the
      appendices.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="background" title="Background on YANG packages">
      <t>It has long been acknowledged within the YANG community that network
      management using YANG requires a unit of organization and conformance
      that is broader in scope than individual YANG modules.</t>

      <t>'The YANG Package Statement' <xref
      target="I-D.bierman-netmod-yang-package"/> proposed a YANG package
      mechanism based on new YANG language statements, where a YANG package is
      defined in a file similar to how YANG modules are defined, and would
      require enhancements to YANG compilers to understand the new statements
      used to define packages.</t>

      <t>OpenConfig <xref target="openconfigsemver"/> describes an approach to
      versioning 'bundle releases' based on git tags. I.e. a set of modules,
      at particular versions, can be marked with the same release tag to
      indicate that they are known to interoperate together.</t>

      <t>The NETMOD WG in general, and the YANG versioning design team in
      particular, are exploring solutions <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-solutions"/> to the YANG versioning
      requirements, <xref target="I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs"/>.
      Solutions to the versioning requirements can be split into several
      distinct areas. <xref target="I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning"/>
      is focused on YANG versioning scoped to individual modules. The overall
      solution must also consider YANG versioning and conformance scoped to
      sets of modules. YANG packages provide part of the solution for versioning
      sets of modules.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="objectives" title="Objectives">
      <t>The main goals of YANG package definitions include, but are not
      restricted to: <list style="symbols">
          <t>To provide an alternative, simplified, YANG conformance
          mechanism. Rather than conformance being performed against a set of
          individual YANG module revisions, features, and deviations,
          conformance can be more simply stated in terms of YANG packages,
          with a set of modifications (e.g. additional modules, deviations, or
          features).</t>

          <t>To allow datastore schema to be specified in a concise way rather than
          having each server explicitly list all modules, revisions, and
          features. YANG package definitions can be defined in documents that
          are available offline, and accessible via a URL, rather than
          requiring explicit lists of modules to be shared between client and
          server. Hence, a YANG package must contain sufficient information to
          allow a client or server to precisely construct the schema
          associated with the package.</t>

          <t>To define a mainly linear versioned history of sets of modules
          versions that are known to work together. I.e. to help mitigate the
          problem where a client must manage devices from multiple vendors,
          and vendor A implements version 1.0.0 of module foo and version
          2.0.0 of module bar, and vendor B implements version 2.0.0 of module
          foo and version 1.0.0 of module bar. For a client, trying to
          interoperate with multiple vendors, and many YANG modules, finding a
          consistent lowest common denominator set of YANG module versions may
          be difficult, if not impossible.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Protocol mechanisms of how clients can negotiate which packages or
      package versions are to be used for NETCONF/RESTCONF communications are
      outside the scope of this document, and are defined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-ver-selection"/>.</t>

      <t>Finally, the package definitions proposed by this document are
      intended to be relatively basic in their definition and the
      functionality that they support. As industry gains experience using YANG
      packages, the standard YANG mechanisms of updating, or augmenting YANG
      modules could also be used to extend the functionality supported by YANG
      packages, if required.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="package" title="YANG Package Definition">
      <t>This document specifies an approach to defining YANG packages that is
      different to either of the approaches described in the background.</t>

      <t>A YANG package is a versioned organizational structure used to manage
	  a set of YANG modules that collectively define a package schema.</t>

      <t>Each YANG package has a name that SHOULD end with the suffix "-pkg".
      Package names are normally expected to be globally unique, but in some
      cases the package name may be locally scoped to a server or device, as
      described in <xref target="package-scope"/>.</t>

      <t>YANG packages are versioned using the same approaches described in
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning"/> and <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-semver"/>. This is described in further
      detail in <xref target="versioning"/>.</t>

      <t>Each YANG package version, defines: <list style="symbols">
          <t>some metadata about the package, e.g., description, tags,
          scoping, referential completeness, location information.</t>

          <t>a set of YANG modules, at particular revisions, that are
          implemented by servers that implement the package. The modules may
          contain deviations.</t>

          <t>a set of import-only YANG modules, at particular revisions, that
          are used 'import-only' by the servers that implement the
          package.</t>

          <t>a set of included YANG packages, at particular revisions, that
          are also implemented by servers that implement the package.</t>

          <t>a set of YANG module features that must be supported by servers
          that implement the package.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The structure for YANG package definitions uses existing YANG
      language statements, YANG Data Structure Extensions <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-data-ext"/>, and YANG Instance Data File
      Format <xref target="I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-instance-file-format"/>.</t>

      <t>YANG package definitions are available offline in YANG instance data
      files. Client applications can be designed to support particular package
      versions that they expect to interoperate with.</t>

      <t>YANG package definitions are available from the server via
      augmentations to YANG Library <xref target="RFC8525"/>. Rather than
      client applications downloading the entire contents of YANG library to
      confirm that the server's datastore schema are compatible with the client, 
	  they can check, or download, a much shorter YANG package definition, and 
	  validate that it conforms to the expected datastore schema.
	  TBD: did we mean "check the package name & version rather than 
	  the entire package definition (which would include the list of modules) ?</t>

      <t>YANG package definitions can also be used to define the content schema
      associated with YANG instance data files holding other, e.g., non
      packages related, instance data.</t>

      <section anchor="definition" title="Package definition rules">
        <t>Packages are defined using the following rules: <list
            style="numbers">
            <t>A YANG package MAY represent a referentially complete set of 
			modules or MAY represent a set of modules with some module import 
			dependencies missing, as described in <xref target="completeness"/>.</t>

            <t>Packages definitions are hierarchical. A package can include
            other packages. Only a single version of a package can be
            included, and conflicting package includes (e.g. from descendant
            package includes) MUST be explicitly resolved by indicating which
            version takes precedence, and which versions are being
            replaced.</t>

            <t>For each module implemented by a package, only a single
            revision of that module MUST be implemented. Multiple revisions of
            a module MAY be listed as import-only dependencies.</t>

            <t>The revision of a module listed in the package 'module' list
            supersedes any 'implemented' revision of the module listed in an
            included package module list. The 'replaces-revision' leaf-list is
            used to indicate which 'implemented' or 'import-only' module
            revisions are replaces by this module revision. This allows a
            package to explicitly resolve conflicts between implemented module
            revisions in included packages.</t>

            <t>The 'replaces-revision' leaf-list in the 'import-only-module'
            list can be used to exclude duplicate revisions of import-only
            modules from included packages. Otherwise, the import-only-modules
            for a package are the import-only-modules from all included
            packages combined with any modules listed in the packages
            import-only-module list.</t>

            <t>YANG packages definitions MAY include modules containing
            deviation statements, but those deviation statements MUST only be
            used in an RFC 7950 compatible way to indicate where a server, or
            class of servers, deviates from a published standard. Deviations
            MUST NOT be included in a package definition that is part of a
            published standard. See section 5.8.1 for further guidance on the
            use of deviations in YANG packages.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="versioning" title="Package versioning">
        <t>Individual versions of a YANG package are versioned using the
        "revision-label" scheme defined in section 3.3 of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning"/>.</t>

        <section anchor="change_scope"
                 title="Updating a package with a new version">
          <t>Package compatibility is fundamentally defined by how the
          package schema between two package versions has changed.</t>

          <t>When a package definition is updated, the version associated with
          the package MUST be updated appropriately, taking into consideration
          the scope of the changes as defined by the rules below.</t>

          <t>A package definition SHOULD define the previous version of the
          package in the 'previous-version' leaf unless it is the initial
          version of the package. If the 'previous-version' leaf is provided
          then the package definition MUST set the 'nbc-changes' leaf if the

          <t>YANG Semantic Versioning <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-semver"/> MAY be used as an appropriate
          type of revision-label for the package version leaf.</t>

          <t>If the format of the leaf matches the 'yangver:version' type
          specified in ietf-yang-semver.yang, then the package version leaf
          MUST be interpreted as a YANG semantic version number.</t>

          <t>For YANG packages defined by the IETF, YANG semantic version
          numbers MUST be used as the version scheme for YANG packages.</t>

          <t>The rules for incrementing the YANG package version number are
          equivalent to the semantic versioning rules used to version
          individual YANG modules, defined in section 3.2 of <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-semver"/>, but use the rules defined
          previously in <xref target="change_scope"/> to determine whether a
          change is classified as non-backwards-compatible,
          backwards-compatible, or editorial. Where available, the semantic
          version number of the referenced elements in the package (included
          packages or modules) can be used to help determine the scope of

        </section>

        <section title="Revision history">
          <t>YANG packages do not contain a revision history. This is because
          packages may have many revisions and a long revision history would
          bloat the package definition. By recursively examining the
          'previous-version' leaf of a package definition, a full revision
          history (including where non-backwards-compatible changes have

      <section title="Package conformance">
        <t>YANG packages allows for conformance to be checked at a package
        level rather than requiring a client to download all modules,
        revisions, and deviations from the server to ensure that the datastore
        schema used by the server is compatible with the client.</t>

        <t>YANG package conformance is analogous to how YANG <xref
        target="RFC7950"/> requires that servers either implement a module
        faithfully, or otherwise use deviations to indicate areas of
        non-conformance.</t>

        <t>For a top level package representing a datastore schema, servers
        MUST implement the package definition faithfully, including all
        mandatory features.</t>

        <t>Package definitions MAY modify the schema for directly or
        hierarchically included packages through the use of different module
        revisions or module deviations. If the schema of any included package
        is modified in a non-backwards-compatible way then it MUST be
        indicated by setting the 'nbc-modified' leaf to true.</t>

        <section title="Use of YANG semantic versioning">
          <t>Using the YANG semantic versioning scheme for package version
          numbers and module revision labels can help with conformance. In the
          general case, clients should be able to determine the nature of
          changes between two package versions by comparing the version
          number.</t>

          <t>This usually means that a client does not have to be restricted
          to working only with servers that advertise exactly the same version
          of a package in YANG library. Instead, reasonable clients should be
          able to interoperate with any server that supports a package version
          that is backwards compatible to version that the client is designed
          for, assuming that the client is designed to ignore operational
          values for unknown data nodes.</t>

          <t>For example, a client coded to support 'foo' package at version
          1.0.0 should interoperate with a server implementing 'foo' package
          at version 1.3.5, because the YANG semantic versioning rules require
          that package version 1.3.5 is backwards compatible to version
          1.0.0.</t>

          <t>This also has a relevance on servers that are capable of
          supporting version selection because they need not support every
          version of a YANG package to ensure good client compatibility.
          Choosing suitable minor versions within each major version number
          should generally be sufficient, particular if they can avoid
          non-backwards-compatible patch level changes.</t>

        <section anchor="rel_with_datastores"
                 title="The relationship between packages and datastores">
          <t>As defined by NMDA <xref target="RFC8342"/>, each datastore has
          an associated datastore schema. Sections 5.1 and 5.3 of NMDA defines
          further constraints on the schema associated with datastores. These
          constraints can be summarized thus: <list style="symbols">
              <t>The schema for all conventional datastores is the same.</t>

              <t>The schema for non conventional configuration datastores
              (e.g., dynamic datastores) may completely differ (i.e. no
              overlap at all) from the schema associated with the conventional
              configuration datastores, or may partially or fully overlap with
              the schema of the conventional configuration datastores. A
              dynamic datastore, for example, may support different modules
              than conventional datastores, or may support a subset or
              superset of modules, features, or data nodes supported in the
              conventional configuration datastores. Where a data node exists
              in multiple datastore schema it has the same type, properties
              and semantics.</t>

              <t>The schema for the operational datastore is intended to be a
              superset of all the configuration datastores (i.e. includes all
              the schema nodes from the conventional configuration
              datastores), but data nodes can be omitted if they cannot be
              accurately reported. The operational datastore schema can
              include additional modules containing only config false data
              nodes, but there is no harm in including those modules in the
              configuration datastore schema as well.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Given that YANG packages represent a schema, it follows that
          each datastore schema can be represented using packages. In
          addition, the schema for most datastores on a server are often
          closely related. Given that there are many ways that a datastore
          schema could be represented using packages, the following guidance
          provides a consistent approach to help clients understand the
          relationship between the different datastore schema supported by a
          device (e.g., which parts of the schema are common and which parts
          have differences): <list style="symbols">
              <t>Any datastores (e.g., conventional configuration datastores)
              that have exactly the same datastore schema MUST use the same
              package definitions. This is to avoid, for example, the creation
              of a 'running-cfg' package and a separate 'intended-cfg' package
              that have identical schema.</t>

              <t>Common package definitions SHOULD be used for those parts of
              the datastore schema that are common between datastores, when
              those datastores do not share exactly the same datastore schema.
              E.g., if a substantial part of the schema is common between the
              conventional, dynamic, and operational datastores then a single
              common package can be used to describe the common parts, along
              with other packages to describe the unique parts of each
              datastore schema.</t>

              <t>YANG modules that do not contain any configuration data nodes
              SHOULD be included in the package for configuration datastores
              if that helps unify the package definitions.</t>

              <t>The packages for the operational datastore schema MUST
              include all packages for all configuration datastores, along
              with any required modules defining deviations to mark
              unsupported data nodes. The deviations MAY be defined directly
              in the packages defining the operational datastore schema, or in
              separate non referentially complete packages.</t>

              <t>The schema for a datastore MAY be represented using a single
              package or as the union of a set of compatible packages, i.e.,
              equivalently to a set of non-conflicting packages being included
              together in an overarching package definition.</t>

      <section anchor="completeness" title="Schema referential completeness">
        <t>A YANG package may represent a schema that is 'referentially
        complete', or 'referentially incomplete', indicated in the package
        definition by the 'complete' flag.</t>

        <t>If all import statements in all YANG modules included in the
        package (either directly, or through included packages) can be
        resolved to a module revision defined with the YANG package
        definition, then the package is classified as referentially complete.
        Conversely, if one or more import statements cannot be resolved to a
        module specified as part of the package definition, then the package
        is classified as referentially incomplete.</t>

        <t>A package that represents the exact contents of a datastore schema
        MUST always be referentially complete.</t>

        <t>Referentially incomplete packages can be used, along with locally
        scoped packages, to represent an update to a device's datastore schema
        as part of an optional software hot fix. E.g., the base software is
        made available as a complete globally scoped package. The hot fix is
        made available as an incomplete globally scoped package. A device's
        datastore schema can define a local package that implements the base
        software package updated with the hot fix package.</t>

        <t>Referentially incomplete packages could also be used to group sets
        of logically related modules together, but without requiring a fixed
        dependency on all imported 'types' modules (e.g., iana-if-types.yang),
        instead leaving the choice of specific revisions of 'types' modules to
        be resolved when the package definition is used.</t>

        <t>However, YANG package definitions also include the list of

      </section>

      <section title="YANG Package Usage Guidance">
        <t>It is RECOMMENDED that organizations that publish YANG modules also
        publish YANG package definition that group and version those modules
        into units of related functionality. This increases interoperability,
        by encouraging implementations to use the same collections of YANG
        modules versions. Using packages also makes it easier to understand
        relationship between modules, and enables functionality to be
        described on a more abstract level than individual modules.</t>

        <section title="Use of deviations in YANG packages">
          <t><xref target="RFC7950"/> section 5.6.3 defines deviations as the
          mechanism to allow servers to indicate where they do not conform to
          a published YANG module that is being implemented.</t>

          <t>In cases where implementations contain deviations from published
          packages, then those implementations SHOULD define a package that
          includes both the published packages and all modules containing
          deviations. This implementation specific package accurately reflects
          the schema used by the device and allows clients to determine how
          the implementation differs from the published package schema in an
          offline consumable way, e.g., when published in an instance data
          file (see section 6).</t>

          <t>Organizations may wish to reuse YANG modules and YANG packages
          published by other organizations for new functionality. Sometimes,
          they may desire to modify the published YANG modules. However, they
          MUST NOT use deviations in an attempt to achieve this because such
          deviations cause two problems:</t>

          <t><list style="hanging">
              <t>They prevent implementations from reporting their own
              deviations for the same nodes.</t>

              <t>They fracture the ecosystem by preventing implementations
              from conforming to the standards specified by both
              organizations. This hurts the interoperability in the YANG
              community, promotes development of disconnected functional
              silos, and hurts creativity in the market.</t>

        <section title="Use of features in YANG modules and YANG packages">
          <t>The YANG language supports feature statements as the mechanism to

          SHOULD make use of appropriate feature statements to provide
          flexibility in how YANG modules may be used by implementations and
          used by YANG modules published by other organizations.</t>

          <t>YANG packages support 'mandatory features' which allow a package
          to specify features that MUST be implemented by any conformant

      <t>The YANG packages module also augments YANG library to allow a server

      available offline in instance data files, it may be sufficient for a
      client to only check that a compatible version of the package is
      implemented by the server without fetching either the package
      definition, or downloading and comparing the full list of modules and
      enabled features.</t>

      <t>If a server indicates that a datastore schema maps to a particular
      package, then it MUST exactly match the schema defined by that package,
      taking into account enabled features and any deviations.</t>

      <t>If a server cannot faithfully implement a package then it can define
      a new package to accurately report what it does implement. The new
      package can include the original package as an included package, and the
      new package can define additional modules containing deviations to the
      modules in the original package, allowing the new package to accurately
      describe the server's behavior. There is no specific mechanism provided
      to indicate that a mandatory-feature in package definition is not
      supported on a server, but deviations MAY be used to disable
      functionality predicated by an if-feature statement.</t>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The YANG modules specified in this document defines a schema for data
      that is accessed by network management protocols such as NETCONF <xref
      target="RFC6241"/> or RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>. The lowest
      NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer, and the
      mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) <xref
      target="RFC6242"/>. The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the
      mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS <xref
      target="RFC5246"/>.</t>

      <t>The NETCONF access control model <xref target="RFC6536"/> provides
      the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to
      a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
      operations and content.</t>

      <t>Similarly to YANG library <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-netconf-rfc7895bis"/>, some of the readable data nodes
      in these YANG modules may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
      network environments. It is thus important to control read access (e.g.,
      via get, get-config, or notification) to these data nodes.</t>

      <t>One additional key different to YANG library, is that the
      'ietf-yang-package' YANG module defines a schema to allow YANG packages
      to be defined in YANG instance data files, that are outside the security
      controls of the network management protocols. Hence, it is important to
      also consider controlling access to these package instance data files to
      restrict access to sensitive information.</t>

      <t>As per the YANG library security considerations, the module, revision
      and version information in YANG packages may help an attacker identify
      the server capabilities and server implementations with known bugs since
      the set of YANG modules supported by a server may reveal the kind of
      device and the manufacturer of the device. Server vulnerabilities may be
      specific to particular modules, module revisions, module features, or
      even module deviations. For example, if a particular operation on a
      particular data node is known to cause a server to crash or
      significantly degrade device performance, then the YANG packages
      information will help an attacker identify server implementations with
      such a defect, in order to launch a denial-of-service attack on the
      device.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="iana" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>It is expected that a central registry of standard YANG package
      definitions is required to support this solution.</t>

      <t>It is unclear whether an IANA registry is also required to manage
      specific package versions. It is highly desirable to have a specific
      canonical location, under IETF control, where the definitive YANG
      package versions can be obtained from.</t>

      <t>This section provides various examples of YANG packages, and as such
      this text is non-normative. The purpose of the examples is to only
      illustrate the file format of YANG packages, and how package
      dependencies work. It does not imply that such packages will be defined
      by IETF, or which modules would be included in those packages even if
      they were defined. For brevity, the examples exclude namespace
      declarations, and use a shortened URL of "tiny.cc/ietf-yang" as a

        <t>This section provides an instance data file example of an IETF
        Network Device YANG package formatted in JSON.</t>

        <t>This example package is intended to represent the standard set of
        YANG modules, with import dependencies, to implement a basic network
        device without any dynamic routing or layer 2 services. E.g., it
        includes functionality such as system information, interface and basic
        IP configuration.</t>

        <t>As for all YANG packages, all import dependencies are fully
        resolved. Because this example uses YANG modules that have been
        standardized before YANG semantic versioning, they modules are
        referenced by revision date rather than version number.</t>

        <t>This section provides an instance data file example of a basic IETF
        Routing YANG package formatted in JSON.</t>

        <t>This example package is intended to represent the standard set of
        YANG modules, with import dependencies, that builds upon the
        example-ietf-network-device YANG package to add support for basic
        dynamic routing and ACLs.</t>

        <t>As for all YANG packages, all import dependencies are fully
        resolved. Because this example uses YANG modules that have been
        standardized before YANG semantic versioning, they modules are
        referenced by revision date rather than version number. Locations have
        been excluded where they are not currently known, e.g., for YANG
        modules defined in IETF drafts. In a normal YANG package, locations
        would be expected to be provided for all YANG modules.</t>

               title="Package import conflict resolution example">
        <t>This section provides an example of how a package can resolve
        conflicting module versions from imported packages.</t>

        <t>In this example, YANG package 'example-3-pkg' imports both
        'example-import-1' and 'example-import-2' packages. However, the two
        imported packages implement different versions of 'example-module-A'
        so the 'example-3-pkg' package selects version '1.2.3' to resolve the
        conflict. Similarly, for import-only modules, the 'example-3-pkg'
        package does not require both versions of example-types-module-C to be
        imported, so it indicates that it only imports revision '2018-11-26'
        and not '2018-01-01'.</t>

    <section anchor="alternatives" title="Possible alternative solutions">
      <t>This section briefly describes some alternative solutions. It can be
      removed if this document is adopted as a WG draft.</t>

      <section title="Using module tags">
        <t>Module tags have been suggested as an alternative solution, and
        indeed that can address some of the same requirements as YANG packages
        but not all of them.</t>

        <t>Module tags can be used to group or organize YANG modules. However,
        this raises the question of where this tag information is stored.
        Module tags either require that the YANG module files themselves are
        updated with the module tag information (creating another versioning
        problem), or for the module tag information to be hosted elsewhere,
        perhaps in a centralize YANG Catalog, or in instance data files
        similar to how YANG packages have been defined in this draft.</t>

        <t>One of the principle aims of YANG packages is to be a versioned
        object that defines a precise set of YANG modules versions that work
        together. Module tags cannot meet this aim without an explosion of
        module tags definitions (i.e. a separate module tag must be defined
        for each package version).</t>

        <t>Module tags cannot support the hierachical scheme to construct
        schema that is proposed in this draft.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Using YANG library">
        <t>Another question is whether it is necessary to define new YANG
        modules to define YANG packages, and whether YANG library could just
        be reused in an instance data file. The use of YANG packages offers
        several benefits over just using YANG library: <list style="numbers">
            <t>Packages allow schema to be built in a hierarchical fashion.
            <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-rfc7895bis"/> only allows one layer
            of hierarchy (using module sets), and there must be no conflicts
            between module revisions in different module-sets.</t>

            <t>Packages can be made available off the box, with a well defined
            unique name, avoiding the need for clients to download, and
            construct/check the entire schema for each datastore. YANG
            library's use of a 'content-id' is unique only to the device that
            generated them.</t>

            <t>Packages may be versioned using a semantic versioning scheme,
            YANG library does not provide a schema level semantic version
            number.</t>

            <t>For a YANG library instance data file to contain the necessary
            information, it probably needs both YANG library and various
            augmentations (e.g. to include each module's semantic version
            number), unless a new version of YANG library is defined
            containing this information. The module definition for a YANG
            package is specified to contain all of the ncessary information to
            solve the problem without augmentations</t>

            <t>YANG library is designed to publish information about the
            modules, datastores, and datastore schema used by a server. The
            information required to construct an off box schema is not
            precisely the same, and hence the definitions might deviate from
            each other over time.</t>
