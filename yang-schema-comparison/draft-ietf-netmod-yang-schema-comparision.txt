              draft-ietf-netmod-yang-schema-comparison-02

Abstract

   This document specifies an algorithm for comparing two revisions of a
   YANG schema to determine the scope of changes, and a list of changes,
   between the revisions.  The output of the algorithm can be used to
   help select an appropriate revision-label or YANG semantic version
   number for a new revision.  This document defines a YANG extension
   that provides YANG annotations to help the tool accurately determine
   the scope of changes between two revisions.

1.  Introduction

   Warning, this is an early (-00) draft with the intention of scoping
   the outline of the solution, hopefully for the WG to back the
   direction of the solution.  Refinement of the solution details is
   expected, if this approach is accepted by the WG.

   This document defines a solution to Requirement 2.2 in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs].  Complementary documents
   provide a complete solution to the YANG versioning requirements, with
   the overall relationship of the solution drafts described in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-solutions].

Internet-Draft           YANG Schema Comparison             October 2022


   YANG module 'revision-labels'
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning] and the use of YANG semantic
   version numbers [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-semver] can be used to help
   manage and report changes between revisions of individual YANG
   modules.

   YANG packages [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-packages] along with YANG
   semantic version numbers can be used to help manage and report
   changes between revisions of YANG schema.

   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning] and
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-packages] define how to classify changes
   between two module or package revisions, respectively, as backwards
   compatible or non-backwards-compatible.
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-semver] refines the definition, to allow
   backwards compatible changes to be classified as 'minor changes' or
   'editorial changes'.

   'Revision-label's and YANG semantic version numbers, whilst being
   generally simple and helpful in the mainline revision history case,
   are not sufficient in all scenarios.  For example, when comparing two
   revisions/versions on independent revision branches, without a direct
   ancestor relationship between the two revisions/versions.  In this
   cases, an algorithmic comparison approach is beneficial.

   In addition, the module revision history's 'nbc-changes' extension
   statement, and YANG semantic version numbers, effectively declare the
   worst case scenario.  If any non-backwards-compatible changes are
   restricted to only parts of the module/schema that are not used by an
   operator, then the operator is able to upgrade, and effectively treat
   the differences between the two revisions/versions as backwards
   compatible because they are not materially impacted by the non-
   backwards-compatible changes.

   Hence, this document defines algorithms that can be applied to
   revisions of YANG modules or versions of YANG schema (e.g., as
   represented by YANG packages), to determine the changes, and scope of
   changes between the revisions/versions.

   For many YANG statements, programmatic tooling can determine whether
   the changes between the statements constitutes a backwards-compatible
   or non-backwards-compatible change.  However, for some statements, it
   is not feasible for current tooling to determine whether the changes
   are backwards-compatible or not.  For example, in the general case,
   tooling cannot determine whether the change in a YANG description
   statement causes a change in the semantics of a YANG data node.  If
   the change is to fix a typo or spelling mistake then the change can
   be classified as an editorial backwards-compatible change.

   Conversely, if the change modifies the behavioral specification of
   the data node then the change would need to be classified as either a
   non editorial backwards-compatible change or a non-backwards-
   compatible change.  Hence, extension statements are defined to
   annotate a YANG module with additional information to clarify the
   scope of changes in cases that cannot be determined by algorithmic
   comparison.

   Open issues are tracked at https://github.com/netmod-wg/yang-ver-dt/
   issues, tagged with 'schema-comparison'.

2.  Terminology and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the following terminology introduced in
   the YANG 1.1 Data Modeling Language [RFC7950]:

   *  schema node

   This document uses terminology introduced in the YANG versioning
   requirements document [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs].

   This document makes of the following terminology introduced in the
   YANG Packages [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-packages]:

   *  YANG schema

   In addition, this document defines the terminology:

   *  Change scope: Whether a change between two revisions is classified
      as non-backwards-compatible, backwards-compatible, or editorial.

   *  Node compatibility statement: An extension statements (e.g. nbc-
      change-at) that can be used to indicate the backwards
      compatibility of individual schema nodes and specific YANG
      statements.

3.  Generic YANG schema tree comparison algorithm

   The generic schema comparison algorithm works on any YANG schema.
   This could be a schema associated with an individual YANG module, or
   a YANG schema represented by a set of modules, e.g., specified by a
   YANG package.

Internet-Draft           YANG Schema Comparison             October 2022


   The algorithm performs a recursive tree wise comparison of two
   revisions of a YANG schema, with the following behavior:

      The comparison algorithm primarily acts on the parts of the schema
      defined by unique identifiers.

      Each identifier is qualified with the name of the module that
      defines the identifier.

      Identifiers in different namespaces (as defined in 6.2.1 or RFC
      7950) are compared separately.  E.g., 'features' are compared
      separately from 'identities'.

      Within an identifier namespace, the identifiers are compared
      between the two schema revisions by qualified identifier name.
      The 'renamed-from' extension allow for a meaningful comparison
      where the name of the identifier has changed between revisions.
      The 'renamed-from' identifier parameter is only used when an
      identifier in the new schema revision cannot be found in the old
      schema revision.

      YANG extensions, features, identities, typedefs are checked by
      comparing the properties defined by their YANG sub-statements
      between the two revisions.

      YANG groupings, top-level data definition statements, rpcs, and
      notifications are checked by comparing the top level properties
      defined by their direct child YANG sub-statements, and also by
      recursively checking the data definition statements.

      The rules specified in section 3 of
      [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning] determine whether the
      changes are backwards-compatible or non-backwards-compatible.

      The rules specified in section 3.2 of
      [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-packages] determine whether backwards-
      compatible changes are 'minor' or 'editorial'.

      For YANG description", "must", and "when" statements, the
      "backwards-compatible" and "editorial" extension statements can be
      used to mark instances when the statements have changed in a
      backwards-compatible or editorial way.  Since by default the
      comparison algorithm assumes that any changes in these statements
      are non-backwards-compatible.  XXX, more info required here, since
      the revisions in the module history probably need to be available
      for this to work in the general branched revisions case.

      Submodules are not relevant for schema comparison purposes, i.e.
      the comparison is performed after submodule resolution has been
      completed.

3.1.  YANG module revision scope extension annotations


3.2.  Node compatibility extension statements

   In addition to the revision extension statement in (TBD: ref to
   Module Versionning), this document defines YANG extension statements
   to indicate compatibility information for individual schema nodes and
   certain YANG statements.

   The node compatibility extension statements are applicable to schema
   nodes (e.g. leaf, rpc, choice) as defined in [RFC7950], as well as a
   set of YANG statements (e.g. typedef) as listed in the YANG
   definition of the nbc-change-at extension in the ietf-yang-revisions
   module in this document.

   While the top level non-backwards-compatible-revision statement is
   mandatory when there is a non-backwards-compatible change, the node
   compatibility statements are optional.

   For many YANG statements, programmatic tooling can determine whether
   the changes to a statement between two module revisions constitutes a
   backwards-compatible or non-backwards-compatible change.  However,
   for some statements, it may be impractical for tooling to determine
   whether the changes are backwards-compatible or not.  For example, in
   the general case, tooling cannot determine whether the change in a
   YANG description statement causes a change in the semantics of a YANG
   schema node.  If the change is to fix a typo or spelling mistake then
   the change can be classified as an editorial backwards-compatible
   change.  Conversely, if the change modifies the behavioral
   specification of the data node then the change would need to be
   classified as either a non editorial backwards-compatible change or a
   non-backwards- compatible change.  Hence, extension statements are
   defined to annotate a YANG module with additional information to
   clarify the scope of changes in cases that cannot be determined by
   algorithmic comparison.

   Three extensions are defined for schema node compatibility
   information:

   nbc-change-at:  Indicates a specific YANG statement had a non-
      backwards-compatible change at a particular module or sub-module
      revision




Wilton                    Expires 28 April 2023                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           YANG Schema Comparison             October 2022


   bc-change-at:  Indicates a specific YANG statement had a backwards-
      compatible change at a particular module or sub-module revision

   editorial-change-at:  Indicates a specific YANG statement had an
      editorial change at a particular module or sub-module revision.
      The meaning of an editorial change is as per YANG Semver
      [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-semver]

   When a node compatibility statement is added to a schema node in a
   sub-module, the revision indicated for the compatibility statement is
   that of the sub-module.

   Adding, modifying or removing any of the node compatibility
   statements is considered to be a BC change.

   The following example illustrates the node compatibility statements:

                 container some-stuff {
                   leaf used-to-be-a-string {
                     rev:nbc-change-at "3.0.0" {
                       description "Changed from a string to a uint32.";
                     }
                     type uint32;
                   }
                   leaf fixed-my-description-typo {
                     rev:editorial-change-at "2022-06-03";
                     type string;
                     description "This description used to have a typo."
                   }
                   list sir-changed-a-lot {
                     rev:editorial-change-at "3.0.0";
                     rev:bc-change-at "2.3.0";
                     rev:bc-change-at "1.2.1_non_compatible";
                     description "a list of stuff";
                     ordered-by user;
                     key "foo";
                     leaf foo {
                       type string;
                     }
                     leaf thing {
                       type uint8;
                     }
                   }

   Note that an individual YANG statement may have a backwards-
   compatible change in a revision that is non-backwards-compatible
   (e.g. some other node changed in a non-backwards-compatible fashion
   in that particular revision).

Internet-Draft           YANG Schema Comparison             October 2022


   If changes are ported from one branch of YANG model revisions to
   another branch, care must be taken with any node compatibilty
   statements.  A simple copy-n-paste should not be used.  The node
   compatibilty statements may incorrectly reference a revision that is
   not in the history of the new revision.  Further, the statements
   might not apply depending on what the history is like in that new
   branch (e.g., an NBC change that is ported might not be an NBC change
   in the new branch).  Node compatiblity statements should not be
   copied over to the new branch.  Instead, the changes should be
   considered as completely new on the new branch, and any compatibility
   information should be generated from scratch.

   When a node compatibility statement is present, that compatibilty
   statement is the authoritative classification of the backwards
   compatibility of the change to the schema node in the specifed
   revision.  This allows a human author to explicitly communicate the
   compatibilty and potentially override the rules specified in this
   document.  This is useful in a number of situations including:

   *  When a tool may not be able to accurately determine the
      compatibilty of a change.  For example, a change in a 'pattern' or
      'must' statement can be difficult for a user or tool to determine
      if it is a compatible change.

   *  When a pattern, range or other statement is changed to more
      correctly define the server constraint.  An example is correcting
      a pattern that incorrectly included 355.xxx.xxx.xxx as a possible
      IPv4 address to make it only accept up to 255.xxx.xxx.xxx.

   Nothing about the backwards compatibility of a schema node is implied
   by the absence of a node compatibility statement.  Hence, the schema
   node definition must be compared between the two revisions to
   determine the backwards compatibility.

   If any nbc-change-at extension statements exists in a module or sub-
   module, then the module or sub-module MUST have non-backwards-
   compatible-revision substatements in each revision statement of the
   module or sub-module history where the revision matches the argument
   of any nbc-change-at statements.  If any revision statements are
   removed, then all node compatibiilty statements that reference that
   revision MUST also be removed.  Conversely, node compatibilty
   statements MUST NOT be removed unless the associated revision
   statement in the revision history is removed.

   If a node compatiblity statement is added to a grouping, then all
   instances where the grouping is used in the module or by an importing
   module are also impacted by the compatibilty information.  Similarly
   for a 'typedef', all leafs and list-lists that use that typedef share

Internet-Draft           YANG Schema Comparison             October 2022


   the specified compatibility classification.  A non-backwards-
   compatible change to a typedef or grouping defined in one module that
   is used by an importing module, does not cause the importing module
   to add a non-backwards-compatible-revision statement to the revision
   history.  Non-backwards-compatible marking does not carry through
   import statements.

   A node compatibility statement at a leaf, leaf-list or typedef
   context takes precedence over a node compatibility statement in a
   typedef used by the leaf, leaf-list or typedef.  If multiple typedefs
   with compatibility statements are used by a leaf, leaf-list or
   typedef (e.g. a union), and there is no compatibility statement at
   the top leaf, leaf-list or typedef context, then the order of
   precedence used to classify the compatibility of the top level leaf,
   leaf-list or typedef is as follows: nbc-change-at, bc-change-at and
   finally editorial-change-at.  That is, the leaf, leaf-list or typedef
   takes the most impactful change classification of all the underlying
   typedefs.

   Node compatibility statements are not supported on YANG statements
   such as 'pattern' or 'range'.  The compatibility statement instead
   goes against the leaf, leaf-list or typedef context.

   Node compatibility statements that refer to pre-release revisions of
   a module MUST be removed when a full release revision of the module
   is published.

   Node compatibilty statements SHOULD NOT be used when it isn't clear
   which change the statement is referring to.  For example: If a leaf
   is reordered within a container, a node compatibility statement
   SHOULD NOT be used against the parent container nor against the
   reordered leaf.  Similarly, if a leaf is renamed or moved to another
   context without keeping the old leaf present in the model and marked
   obsolete, a node compatibilty statement SHOULD not be used.

4.  YANG module comparison algorithm

   The schema comparison algorithm defined in Section 3 can be used to
   compare the schema for individual modules, but with the following
   modifications:

      Changes to the module's metadata information (i.e. module level
      description, contact, organization, reference) should be checked
      (as potential editorial changes).

      The module's revision history should be ignored from the
      comparison.

Internet-Draft           YANG Schema Comparison             October 2022


      Changes to augmentations and deviations should be sorted by path
      and compared.

5.  YANG schema comparison algorithms

5.1.  Standard YANG schema comparison algorithm

   The standard method for comparing two YANG schema versions is to
   individually compare the module revisions for each module implemented
   by the schema using the algorithm defined in Section 4 and then
   aggregating the results together:

   *  If all implemented modules in the schema have only changed in an
      editorial way then the schema is changed in an editorial way

   *  If all implemented modules in the schema have only been changed in
      an editorial or backwards-compatible way then the schema is
      changed in a backwards-compatible way

   *  Otherwise if any implemented module in the schema has been changed
      in a non-backwards-compatible way then the schema is changed in a
      non-backwards-compatible way.

   The standard schema comparison method is the RECOMMENDED scheme to
   calculate the version number change for new versions of YANG
   packages, because it allows the package version to be calculated
   based on changes to implemented modules revision history (or YANG
   semantic version number if used to identify module revisions).

5.2.  Filtered YANG schema comparison algorithm

   Another method to compare YANG schema, that is less likely to report
   inconsequential differences, is to construct full schema trees for
   the two schema versions, directly apply a version of the comparison
   algorithm defined in Section 3.  This may be particular useful when
   the schema represents a complete datastore schema for a server
   because it allows various filtered to the comparison algorithm to
   provide a more specific answer about what changes may impact a
   particular client.

   The full schema tree can easily be constructed from a YANG package
   definition, or alternative YANG schema definition.

   Controlled by input parameters to the comparison algorithm, the
   following parts of the schema trees can optionally be filtered during
   the comparison:

Internet-Draft           YANG Schema Comparison             October 2022


      All "grouping" statements can be ignored (after all "use"
      statements have been processed when constructing the schema).

      All module and submodule metadata information (i.e. module level
      description, contact, organization, reference) can be ignored.

      The comparison can be restricted to the set of features that are
      of interest (different sets of features may apply to each schema
      versions).

      The comparison can be restricted to the subset of data nodes,
      RPCs, notifications and actions, that are of interest (e.g., the
      subset actually used by a particular client), providing a more
      meaningful result.

      The comparison could filter out backwards-compatible 'editorial'
      changes.

   In addition to reporting the overall scope of changes at the schema
   level, the algorithm output can also optionally generate a list of
   specific changes between the two schema, along with the
   classification of those individual changes.

6.  Comparison tooling

   'pyang' has some support for comparison two module revisions, but
   this is currently limited to a linear module history.

   TODO, it would be helpful if there is reference tooling for schema
   comparison.

7.  Module Versioning Extension YANG Modules
