                         YANG Schema Comparison
              draft-ietf-netmod-yang-schema-comparison-05

Abstract

   This document specifies an algorithm for comparing two revisions of a
   YANG schema to determine the scope of changes, and a list of changes,
   between the revisions.  The output of the algorithm can be used to
   help select an appropriate revision-label or YANG semantic version
   number for a new revision.  Included is also a YANG module describing
   the output of this algorithm.

1.  Open Issues

   { This section is only to present the current ongoing work, not part
   of the final draft. }

   The following issues have not ben discussed in any wider extent yet.

1.1.  Override/per-node tags

1.2.  Separate rules for config vs state

2.  Introduction

   This document defines the algorithm for comparing two revisions of a
   YANG schema.  There are two kinds of YANG schemas: on-the-wire or
   compiled schema and text or parsed schema.

Internet-Draft           YANG Schema Comparison             October 2025


   The compiled schema is what tools use when working with any kinds of
   YANG data.  Generally, in all the YANG modules, all the schema nodes
   need to be fully resolved and have their final form.  For example,
   every "uses" statement is replaced with the nodes from the
   corresponding "grouping", every type referencing a "typedef" is
   replaced with the type of the "typedef" and so on.  On the other
   hand, the parsed schema is comprised of all the YANG modules together
   as they are.  That means no statements are resolved and they remain
   in exactly the same text form as present in the YANG modules.

   For determining whether a new revision of a YANG 1.1 module is or is
   not backwards-compatible based on all the rules in [RFC7950] and
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning] , both of these schemas
   would be required.  Similarly for YANG 1.0, the rules in [RFC6020] .
   This document defines an algorithm for comparing either only the
   compiled schema or both the parsed and compiled schema.

   The output of this algorithm can be utilized by tools processing YANG
   instance data to determine what exact changes should they expect and
   even how to transform instance data valid for an old revision of a
   YANG module to be valid for a newer revision of the same YANG module.
   Such tools are typically clients or servers of YANG-driven protocols,
   e.g. NETCONF, RESTCONF, or gRPC.

   But, the generated data can also be used by YANG module authors to
   check all the changes made between 2 revisions.  Additionally, it can
   assist with deciding what semantic version should the new revision of
   the module use based on the [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-semver] document.

3.  Terminology and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the following terminology introduced in
   the YANG 1.1 Data Modeling Language [RFC7950]:

   *  schema node

   This document uses terminology introduced in the YANG versioning
   requirements document [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs].

   This document makes of the following terminology introduced in the
   YANG Packages [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-packages]:

   *  YANG schema

   In addition, this document defines the terminology:

   *  TODO

4.  Compiled YANG schema tree

   The compiled schema tree resolves all the statements used for
   syntactic abstraction and simplification to obtain one schema node
   tree with only data definition statements.  Textual fields are kept
   as well because they may affect backwards compatibility of the whole
   YANG module.

   The steps taken when compiling a schema:

   *  'Import' statements are resolved by finding the referenced YANG
      modules and making their contents available.

   *  All submodules of a single module are merged to create one large
      YANG module.

   *  'Uses' statements are replaced by the referenced 'groupings' and
      the YANG nodes they define.

   *  'Types' referencing any 'typedef' statements are replaced with the
      actual type details.

   *  'Augments' are resolved by placing the included YANG nodes in
      their targets.

   *  'Deviation' and 'refine' statements are applied by changing the
      appropriate schema nodes.

   *  All the 'if-feature' statements are evaluated based on the enabled
      'features' of implemented YANG modules and the disabled schema
      nodes are removed.

   After the compilation the result is still a valid YANG module without
   the following statements:

   *  import

   *  include

   *  revision

   *  typedef

   *  grouping

   *  augment

   *  deviation

   *  feature

   *  if-feature

   *  refine

   *  extension

5.  YANG schema tree comparison algorithm

   This algorithm is defined for separate YANG modules.  When comparing
   the compiled schema, all the non data-definition statements are first
   considered and then all the data-definition statements, recursively.
   These schema-only statements are skipped:

   *  choice

   *  case

   When comparing the parsed schema, the algorithm operates in the same
   fashion but compares all the YANG statements.  However, only in the
   selected YANG module ignoring imported and included modules.

   The non data-definition statements are considered modified when their
   content is changed or any of their substatements are changed.  If a
   statement is present in the old revision of a module and missing in
   the new revision, it is considered removed.  Vice-versa, if missing
   in the old revision but present in the new revision, it is considered
   added.

   Data-definition statements are compared similarly except that a
   change in a descendant data-definition statement is not considered a
   change of the parent data-definition statement but a separate change
   instead.

   Only statements with any changes are reported and included in the
   algorithm output.

5.1.  Module identification

   When generating the comparison output of two compiled schemas, unique
   identification of the modules in question in included.  For both the
   old and the new revision of the module, its name, revision, list of
   submodules, and a leaf-list of enabled features is included.  In
   addition, the same information is reported for all the imported YANG
   modules, recursively.  This ensures that if any other output is
   produced with a different set of changes for two YANG modules, their
   identification information must also differ.

5.2.  Change content

   Non-data-definition statements are uniquely identified with their
   YANG identifier and data-definition statements with their absolute
   schema data node-ids.

   For every change, the changed statement and the parent of the changed
   statement are included.  While redundant in many cases, it allows to
   uniquely report changes in nested statements, e.g. an extension
   instance change in the type of a leaf statement.  Also, all the
   unchanged substatements with their value or content are included for
   every changed statement, for both older and newer revision of the
   YANG module, if applicable.  This ensures that the output includes
   all the possibly required information without relying on learning it
   from the YANG modules themselves.

5.3.  Change conformance

   Every change is classified as either backwards-compatible or non-
   backwards-compatible based on sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning].  But, there are cases when
   it is impossible for tooling to determine whether a change is
   backwards-compatible or not.  The affected statements are:

   *  pattern

   *  when

   *  must

   *  description

   *  extension instance

   Normally, any change in these statement is reported as non-backwards-
   compatible.  However, if the author of the new revision of a YANG
   module determines that the change of an aforementioned statement is

   backwards-compatible based on the compatibility rules for the
   specific statement, they can decide to use the 'schema-cmp:backwards-
   compatible' extension to signify this fact.  Then, this change must
   be reported as backwards-compatible.

6.  Comparison tooling

   The `yanglint` tool from the libyang library (in separate Git branch
   schema_comparison) is able to generate the `ietf-yang-schema-
   comparison` YANG data of two revisions of a YANG module.

7.  Schema Comparison YANG Module

   YANG module with nodes describing the differences between two
   revisions of YANG schemas.  The "ietf-yang-schema-comparison" YANG
   module imports definitions from the "ietf-yang-types" module defined
   in [RFC6991] and "ietf-yang-library" module defined in [RFC8525], and
   "ietf-yang-structure-ext" module defined in [RFC8791].

   The ideas for a tooling based comparison of YANG module revisions was
   first described in [I-D.clacla-netmod-yang-model-update].  This
   document extends upon those initial ideas.

9.  Security Considerations

   This section follows the template defined in Section 3.7.1 of
   [RFC8407].

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be used by offline tooling to generate output for
   differences in supplied YANG modules.

   The YANG module specified in this document MAY be accessed via
   network management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF
   [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer,
   and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH)
   [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-
   implement secure transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

Internet-Draft           YANG Schema Comparison             October 2025


   When the module is used for offline tooling there are no security
   considerations, since the user has full access to all YANG modules
   used.

   The structure "schema-comparison" contains all the groupings
   reflecting the changes between YANG modules.  If the data of this
   structure are published in online tooling, care needs to be taken so
   that knowledge of YANG modules is not leaked.

   Since the module does not define any RPCs, actions, or notifications,
   the security considerations for such statements are not provided
   here.

10.  IANA Considerations

10.1.  The "IETF XML" Registry

   This document register one URI in the "ns" subregistry of the IETF
   XML Registry [RFC3688] maintained at
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/xml-registry/xml-registry.xhtml#ns.
   Following the format in [RFC3688], the following registration is
   requested:

       URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-yang-schema-comparison
       Registrant Contact: The IESG.
       XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

10.2.  The "YANG Module Names" Registry

   This document registers one YANG module in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC6020] maintained at https://www.iana.org/assignments/
   yang-parameters/yang-paramaters.xhtml.  Following the format defined
   in [RFC6020], the below registration is requested:

  Name: ietf-yang-schema-comparison
  XML Namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-yang-schema-comparison
  Prefix: schema-cmp
  Reference: RFC XXXX
