                         YANG Schema Comparison
              draft-ietf-netmod-yang-schema-comparison-03

Abstract

   This document specifies an algorithm for comparing two revisions of a
   YANG schema to determine the scope of changes, and a list of changes,
   between the revisions.  The output of the algorithm can be used to
   help select an appropriate revision-label or YANG semantic version
   number for a new revision.  Included is also a YANG module describing
   the output of this algorithm.

   The contributors have identified several key issues that need
   attention.  This section presents selected key issues which have been
   discussed together with suggestions for proposed solution or
   requirements.

1.1.  On-wire vs Schema analysis

   Should one algorithm be used or two?  The consesus reached was to
   define two separate algorithms, one for on-wire format and one for
   schema.

   Schema: any changes that affect the YANG schema in an NBC manner
   according to the full rules of
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning].  This may be important for
   clients that, for example, automatically generate code using the YANG
   and where the change of a typedef name or a choice name could be
   significant.  Also important for other modules that may augment or
   deviate the schema being compared.

   Changes to the module that aren't semantic should raise that there
   has been editorial changes

   Ordering in the schema, RFC 7950 doesn't allow reordering; thus an
   NBC change.

   Open Questions:

   Groupings / uses

   typedefs, namespaces, choice names, prefixes, module metadata.

   *  typedef renaming (on-wire, same base type etc)

   *  Should all editorial (text) diffs be reported?

   *  What about editorial changes that might change semantics, e.g.  a
      description of a leaf?

   *  Metadata arguments which relies on the formatted input text.  E.g
      description, contact (etc), extension (how does the user want to
      tune verbosity level for editorial changes: whitespace, spelling,
      editorial, potentially-nbc?

   *  XPath, must, when: don't normalize XPath expressions

   *  presence statements

1.2.  Comparison on module or full schema (YANG artifact, arbitrary
      blob.  Questions

   *  features

   *  packages vs directories vs libraries vs artifact

   *  package specific comparison, package metadata or only looking at
      the modules

   *  import only or implemented module

   Filter out comparison for a specific subrtree, path etc.  Use case
   for on-wire e.g. yang subscriptions, did the model change fro what is
   subscribed on?

2.  Open Issues

   { This section is only to present the current ongoing work, not part
   of the final draft. }

   The following issues have not ben discussed in any wider extent yet.

2.1.  Override/per-node tags

2.2.  Separate rules for config vs state

2.3.  Tool/report verbosity

   *  where to report changes (module, grouping, typedef, uses)

   *  output level (conceptual level or exact strings)

   *  granularity: error/warning/info level per reported change category

2.4.  sub-modules

2.5.  Write algorithm in pseudo code or just describe the rules/goals in
      text?

2.6.  Categories in the report: bc, nbc, potentially-nbc, editorial.
      Allow filtering in the draft without defining it?

   One option can be to have a tool option that presents the reason
   behind the decision, e.g. --details could be used to explain to the
   user why a certain change was marked as nbc.

Internet-Draft           YANG Schema Comparison             October 2025


   Another option is to present reasoning and analysis in deeper levels
   of verbosity; e.g. one extra level of verbosity, -v, could present
   the reason for categorizing a change nbc, and an additional extra
   level of verbosity, e.g. -vv, could also present the detailed
   analysis the tool made to categorize the change.

2.7.  Only for YANG 1.1?

3.  Introduction

   This document defines the algorithm for comparing two revisions of a
   YANG schema.  There are two kinds of YANG schemas: on-the-wire or
   compiled schema and text or parsed schema.

   The compiled schema is what tools use when working with any kinds of
   YANG data.  Generally, in all the YANG modules, all the schema nodes
   need to be fully resolved and have their final form.  For example,
   every "uses" statement is replaced with the nodes from the
   corresponding "grouping", every type referencing a "typedef" is
   replaced with the type of the "typedef" and so on.  On the other
   hand, the parsed schema is comprised of all the YANG modules together
   as they are.  That means no statements are resolved and they remain
   in exactly the same text form as present in the YANG modules.

   For determining whether a new revision of a YANG 1.1 module is or is
   not backwards-compatible based on all the rules in [RFC7950] and
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning] , both of these schemas
   would be required.  Similarly for YANG 1.0, the rules in [RFC6020] .
   This document defines only the algorithm for comparing the compiled
   schema.  The output of this algorithm can be utilized by tools
   processing YANG instance data to determine what exact changes should
   they expect and even how to transform instance data valid for an old
   revision of a YANG module to be valid for a newer revision of the
   same YANG module.  Such tools are typically clients or servers of
   YANG-driven protocols, e.g.  NETCONF, RESTCONF, or gNMI.

   In addition, the comparison algorithm can assist YANG module authors
   with updating their modules and be used to verify the semantic
   version of the new revision of the YANG module based on the
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-semver] document.

4.  Terminology and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the following terminology introduced in
   the YANG 1.1 Data Modeling Language [RFC7950]:

   *  schema node

   This document uses terminology introduced in the YANG versioning
   requirements document [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs].

   This document makes of the following terminology introduced in the
   YANG Packages [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-packages]:

   *  YANG schema

   In addition, this document defines the terminology:

   *  Change scope: Whether a change between two revisions is classified
      as non-backwards-compatible or backwards-compatible.

   *  Node compatibility statement: An extension statements (e.g. nbc-
      change-at) that can be used to indicate the backwards
      compatibility of individual schema nodes and specific YANG
      statements.

5.  Compiled YANG schema tree

   The compiled schema tree resolves all the statements used for
   syntactic abstraction and simplification to obtain one schema node
   tree with only data definition statements.  Textual fields are kept
   as well because they may affect backwards compatibility of the whole
   YANG module.

   The steps taken when compiling a schema:

   *  'Import' statements are resolved by finding the referenced YANG
      modules and making their contents available.

   *  All submodules of a single module are merged to create one large
      YANG module.

   *  'Uses' statements are replaced by the referenced 'groupings' and
      the YANG nodes they define.

   *  'Types' referencing any 'typedef' statements are replaced with the
      actual type details.

   *  'Augments' are resolved by placing the included YANG nodes in
      their targets.

Internet-Draft           YANG Schema Comparison             October 2025


   *  'Deviation' and 'refine' statements are applied by changing the
      appropriate schema nodes.

   *  All the 'if-feature' statements are evaluated based on the enabled
      'features' of implemented YANG modules and the disabled schema
      nodes are removed.

   After the compilation the result is still a valid YANG module without
   the following statements:

   *  import

   *  include

   *  revision

   *  typedef

   *  grouping

   *  augment

   *  deviation

   *  feature

   *  if-feature

   *  refine

   *  extension

6.  Compiled YANG schema tree comparison algorithm

   This algorithm is defined for separate compiled YANG modules.  It
   first compares all the non data-definition statements in the module
   and then all the data-definition statements recursively.  These
   schema-only statements are skipped:

   *  choice

   *  case

Internet-Draft           YANG Schema Comparison             October 2025


   The non data-definition statements are considered modified when their
   content is changed or any of their substatements are changed.  If a
   statement is present in the old revision of a module and missing in
   the new revision, it is considered removed.  Vice-versa, if missing
   in the old revision but present in the new revision, it is considered
   added.

   Data-definition statements are compared similarly except that a
   change in a descendant data-definition statement is not considered a
   change of the parent data-definition statement but a separate change
   instead.

   Only statements with any changes are reported and included in the
   algorithm output.

6.1.  Module identification

   When generating the comparison output of two compiled YANG modules,
   it includes unique identification of the modules in question.  For
   both the old and the new revision of the module, its name, revision,
   list of submodules, and a leaf-list of enabled features is included.
   In addition, the same information is reported for all the imported
   YANG modules, recursively.  This ensures that if any other output is
   produced with a different set of changes for two YANG modules, their
   identification information must also differ.

6.2.  Change content

   Non-data-definition statements are uniquely identified with their
   YANG identifier and data-definition statements with their absolute
   schema data node-ids.

   For every change, the changed statement and the parent of the changed
   statement are included.  While redundant in many cases, it allows to
   uniquely report changes in nested statements, e.g. an extension
   instance change in the type of a leaf statement.  Also, all the
   substatements with their value or content are included for every
   changed statement, for both older and newer revision of the YANG
   module, if applicable.  This ensures that the output includes all the
   possibly required information without relying on learning it from the
   YANG modules themselves.

6.3.  Change conformance

   Every change is classified as either backwards-compatible or non-
   backwards-compatible based on sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning].  But, there are cases when
   it is impossible for tooling to determine whether a change is
   backwards-compatible or not.  The affected statements are:

   *  pattern

   *  when

   *  must

   *  description

   *  extension instance

   Normally, any change in these statement is reported as non-backwards-
   compatible.  However, if the author of the new revision of a YANG
   module determines that the change of an aforementioned statement is
   backwards-compatible based on the compatibility rules for the
   specific statement, they can decide to use the 'schema-cmp:backwards-
   compatible' extension to signify this fact.  Then, this change must
   be reported as backwards-compatible.

7.  Comparison tooling

   The `yanglint` tool from the libyang library is able to generate the
   `ietf-schema-comparison` YANG data of two revisions of a YANG module.

8.  Schema Comparison YANG Module

   YANG module with nodes describing the differences between two
   revisions of compiled YANG modules.  The "ietf-schema-comparison"
   YANG module imports definitions from the "ietf-yang-types" module
   defined in [RFC6991] and "ietf-yang-library" module defined in
   [RFC8525].

9.  Contributors

   This document grew out of the YANG module versioning design team that
   started after IETF 101.  The following individuals are (or have been)
   members of the design team and have worked on the YANG versioning
   project:

   *  Balazs Lengyel

   *  Benoit Claise

   *  Bo Wu

   *  Ebben Aries

   *  Jason Sterne

   *  Joe Clarke

   *  Juergen Schoenwaelder

   *  Mahesh Jethanandani

   *  Michael Wang

   *  Qin Wu

   *  Reshad Rahman

   *  Rob Wilton

   *  Jan Lindblad

   *  Per Andersson

   The ideas for a tooling based comparison of YANG module revisions was
   first described in [I-D.clacla-netmod-yang-model-update].  This
   document extends upon those initial ideas.

10.  Security Considerations

   This section follows the template defined in Section 3.7.1 of
   [RFC8407].

Internet-Draft           YANG Schema Comparison             October 2025


   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be used by offline tooling to generate output for
   differences in supplied YANG modules.

   The YANG module specifiod in this document MAY be accessed via
   network management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF
   [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer,
   and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH)
   [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-
   implement secure transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   When the module is used for offline tooling there are no security
   considerations, since the user has full access to all YANG modules
   used.

   The container "schema-comparison" contains all the groupings
   reflecting the changes between YANG modules.  If this data node is
   published in online tooling, care needs to be taken so that knowledge
   of YANG modules are not leaked.

   Since the modules does not define any RPCs or actions or
   notifications, and thus the security considerations for such are not
   provided here.

11.  IANA Considerations

11.1.  The "IETF XML" Registry

   This document register one URI in the "ns" subregistry of the IETF
   XML Registry [RFC3688] maintained at
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/xml-registry/xml-registry.xhtml#ns.
   Following the format in [RFC3688], the following registration is
   requested:

          URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-schema-comparison
          Registrant Contact: The IESG.
          XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.
