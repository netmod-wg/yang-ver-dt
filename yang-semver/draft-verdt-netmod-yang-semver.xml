  This document specifies a new YANG module update procedure in case of backward-incompatible
  changes, as an alternative proposal to the YANG 1.1 specifications. This document updates RFC 7950.

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
<t>This document puts forth a solution to the problems described in <xref target="I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs"/>
 by proposing changes to <xref target="RFC7950"/> to address the various requirements that <xref target="I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs"/> specifies.
At this time, the solution herein addresses requirements 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.1, and 5.2.  Current gaps are documented in
<xref target="open_issues_reqs"/> below.</t>
</section>
<section anchor="the_solution" title="The Solution">
  <t>
  The solution is composed of five parts:
       <list style="numbers">
       <t>A semantic versioning YANG extension, along with an optional additional check that validates
	      the semantic versioning from a syntactic point of view, which can either assist in
		  determining the correct semantic versioning value, or which can help in determining
		  the values for YANG modules that do not support this extension. </t>
       <t>An import by semantic version statement</t>
       <t>Updates to the YANG 1.1 module update rules</t>

       <t>An introduction of deprecated and obsolote reason clauses</t>
     </list>
  </t>

  <section anchor="changes_7950" title="Changes to RFC7950">
    <t>
      The following sections introduce potential updates to <xref target="RFC7950"/>:
    <list style="symbols">
      <t><xref target="update_rules"/> which describes modification to the <xref target="RFC7950"/> Section 11
        module update text to advise the use of semantic versioning as described in this document</t>
      <t><xref target="import_semver"/> which describes an extension to do import by semantic version</t>
      <t><xref target="deprecated_and_obsolete_reasons"/> defines an extension that adds a child element to

  </section>

  <section anchor="semver_semantic_versioning" title="Semantic Versioning">
    <section anchor="semantic_versioning_as_set_by_the_YANG_module_designer" title="Semantic Versioning, As Set by the YANG Module Designer">
    <t>
    The semantic versioning solution proposed here has already been proposed in
    <xref target="I-D.openconfig-netmod-model-catalog "/> (included here with
    the authors' permission) which itself is based on <xref target="openconfigsemver"/>.
    The goal is to indicate the YANG module backward (in)compatibility, following semver.org
    semantic versioning <xref target="semver"/>:
    </t>
    <t>
     "The SEMVER version number for the module is introduced. This is
         expressed as a semantic version number of the form: x.y.z
     <list style="symbols">
       <t>x is the MAJOR version. It is incremented when the new version of the specification is
           incompatible with previous versions.</t>
       <t>y is the MINOR version. It is incremented when new functionality is added in a manner
            that is backward-compatible with previous versions.</t>
       <t>z is the PATCH version. It is incremented
            when bug fixes are made in a backward-compatible manner."</t>
     </list>
    </t>
	<t>
    The semantic version value is set by the YANG module developer at the design and implementation times.
    Along these lines, we propose the following YANG 1.1 extension for a more generic
      semantic version.  The formal definition is found at the end of this document.  This semantic version
    extension and the text below address requirements 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 5.1 and 5.2 of <xref target="I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs"/>.</t>

  </section>
  <section anchor="the_derived_semantic_versioning" title="The Derived Semantic Version">
    <t>
      If an explicitly defined semantic version is not available in the YANG module, it is possible to
	  algoritmically calculate a derived semantic version. This can be used for modules not containing
	  a definitive semantic-version as defined in this document or as a starting value when specifying
	  the definitive semantic-version. Be aware that this algorithm may sometimes incorrectly classify
	  changes between the categories non-compatible, compatible or error-correction.
	</t>
  </section>
  <section anchor="implementation_experience" title="Implementation Experience">
   <t>
   <xref target="yangcatalog"/> uses the pyang utility to calculate the derived-semantic-version for all of the modules
   contained within the catalog.  <xref target="yangcatalog"/> contains many revisions of the same module
   in order to provide its derived-semantic-version for module consumers to know what has changed between
   revisions of the same module.
   </t>
   <t>
   Two distinct leafs in the YANG module <xref target="I-D.clacla-netmod-model-catalog"/> contain this semver notation:
   </t>
   <t>
     <list style="symbols">
       <t>the semantic-version leaf contains the value embedded within a YANG module
           (if it is available).
       </t>
       <t>the derived-semantic-version leaf is established by examining the
          the YANG module themselves.  As such derived-semantic-version only
          takes syntax into account as opposed to the meaning of various elements
          when it computes the semantic version.</t>

       <t>The algorithm used to produce the derived-semantic-version is as follows:
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>Order all modules of the same name by revision from oldest to newest.
            Include module revisions that are not available, but which are defined in the revision statements in one of the available module versions. </t>
            <t>If module A, revision N+1 has failed compilation, bump its derived semantic MAJOR version.
            For unavailable module versions assume non-backward compatible changes were done., thus bump its derived semantic MAJOR version.</t>
            <t>Else, run "pyang --check-update-from" on module A, revision N and revision N+1 to see if backward-incompatible changes exist.</t>
            <t>If backward-incompatible changes exist, bump module A, revision N+1's derived MAJOR semantic version.</t>
            <t>If no backward-incompatible changes exist, compare the pyang trees of module A, revision N and revision N+1.</t>
            <t>If there are structural differences (e.g., new nodes), bump module A, revision N+1's derived MINOR semantic version.</t>
            <t>If no structural differences exist, bump module A, revision N+1's derived PATCH semantic version.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
   </list>
   </t>
   <t>
     The pyang utility checks many of the points listed in section 11 of <xref target="RFC7950"/> for known module incompatibilities.
     While this approach is a good way to programmatically obtain a semantic version number, it does not address all cases
     whereby a major version number might need to be increased.  For example, a node may have the same name and same type, but
     its meaning may change from one revision of a module to another.  This represents a semantic change that breaks backward
     compatibility, but the above algorithm would not find it.  Therefore, additional, sometimes manual, rigor must be done
     to ensure a proper version is chosen for a given module revision.
   </t>
  </section>
</section>

  <section title="Import by Semantic Version" anchor="import_semver">
      <t>
      If a module is imported by another one, it is usually not specified which
      revision of the imported module should be used. However, not all revisions
      may be acceptable. Today YANG 1.1 allows one to specify the revision date of the
      imported module, but that is too specific, as even a small spelling
      correction of the imported module results in a change to its revision date,
      thus making the module revision ineligible for import.
      </t><t>
      Using semantic versioning to indicate the acceptable imported module versions
      is much more flexible.  For example:
      <list style="symbols">
          <t>Only a module of a specific MAJOR version is acceptable.  All MINOR and PATCH versions
            can also be imported.</t>
          <t>A module at a specific MAJOR version or higher is acceptable.</t>
          <t>A module at a specific MAJOR.MINOR version is acceptable.  All PATCH versions
            can also be imported.</t>
          <t>A module within a certain range of versions are acceptable.  For example, in this
            case, a module between version 1.0.0 (inclusive) and 3.0.0 (exclusive) are acceptable.</t>
      </list>
       </t>

       <t>The ietf-semver module provides another extension, import-versions that is a child of
         import and specifies the rules for an acceptable set of versions of the given module.
         This extension addresses requirement 1.3 of <xref target="I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs"/>.
         The structure of this extension is specified as follows:</t>

      <t>TODO: How to specify this? One thought is below, not fully formalized as this
        should be discussed further.  Note: while this uses a comma to separate discrete versions,
        we could instead allow for this to be specified multiple times.</t>

       <figure>
         <artwork><![CDATA[
[\[(]X[.Y[.Z]][-[X[.Y[.X]]][\])]][,...]

Where the first character MAY be a '[' or '(' to indicate at least inclusive and at least
 exclusive (respectively).  If this is omitted, a full semantic version must be specified
 and the import will only support this one version.

The following version, if specified with a '[' or '(' indicates the lower bound.  This can
 be a full semantic version or a MAJOR only or MAJOR.MINOR only.

The '-', if specified, is a literal hyphen indicating a range will be specified.  If the second portion
 of the import-versions clause is omitted, then there is no upper bound on what will be considered
 an acceptable imported version.

After the '-' the upper bound semantic version (or part thereof) follows.

After the upper bound version, one of ']' or ')' MUST follow to indicate whether this limit is inclusive
 or exclusive of the upper bound respectively.

Finally, a literal comma (',') MAY be specified with additional ranges.  Each range is taken as a logical
 OR.
          ]]>
        </artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>For example:</t>

      <figure>
        <artwork>
import example-module {
  semver:import-versions "[1.0.0-3.0.0)";
  // All versions between 1.0.0 (inclusive) and 3.0.0 (exclusive) are acceptable.
}

import example-module {
  semver:import-versions "[2-5]";
  // All versions between 2.0.0 (inclusive) and 5.y.z (inclusive) where y and z are
  // any value for MINOR and PATCH versions.
}

import example-module {
  semver:import-versions "[1.5-2.0.0),[2.5";
  // All versions between 1.5.0 (inclusive) and 2.0.0 (exclusive) as well as all versions
  // greater than 2.5 (inclusive).  In this manner, if 2.0 was branched from 1.4, and a
  // new feature was added into 1.5, all versions of 1.x.x starting at 1.5 are allowed,
  // but the feature was not merged into 2.y.z until 2.5.0.
}

import example-module {
  semver:import-versions "[1";
  // All versions greater than MAJOR version 1 are acceptable.  This includes any
  // MINOR or PATCH versions.
}

import example-module {
  semver:import-versions "1.0.0";
  // Only version 1.0.0 is acceptable (this mimics what exists with import by revision).
}

import example-module {
  semver:import-versions "[1.1-2)"";
  // All versions greater than 1.1 (inclusive, and including all PATCH versions off of 1.1)
  // up to MAJOR version 2 (exclusive) are acceptable.
}

import example-module {
  semver:import-versions "[1.1-2),[3";
  // All versions greater than 1.1 (inclusive, and including all PATCH versions off of 1.1)
  // up to MAJOR version 2 (exclusive), as well as all versions greater than MAJOR version 3
  // (inclusive) are acceptable.
}

import example-module {
  semver:import-versions "[1.1-2),[3.0.0";
  // This is equivalent to the example above, simply indicating that a partial semantic version
  // assumes all missing components are 0.
}
        </artwork>
      </figure>

       <t>
       The import statement SHOULD include a semver:import-versions statement and MUST NOT
       include a revision statement.  An import statement MUST NOT contain both a
       semver:import-versions and a revision substatement.  The use of the revision
       substatement for import should be discouraged.
      </t>
</section>

  <section title="Updates to YANG 1.1 Module Update Rules" anchor="update_rules">
      <t>
          RFC 7950 section 11, must be updated to allow for non-backward changes provided they follow the
          semantic versioning guidelines and increase the MAJOR version number when a backward incompatible
          change is made.  This change is in the spirit of requirement 5.1 from <xref target="I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs"/>.
          The following is proposed text for this change.</t>

      <t>
      "As experience is gained with a module, it may be desirable to revise that module.
      Changes to published modules are allowed, even if they have some potential to cause interoperability
      problems, if the module-version YANG extension is used in the revision statement to clearly indicate the nature of the change."
      </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Updates to ietf-yang-library" anchor="ietf_yang_library_updates">
      <t>The ietf-semver YANG module also specifies additional ietf-yang-library <xref target="RFC7895"/>
	    <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-rfc7895bis"/> leafs to be
        added at the module and submodule levels.  The first is module-version, which augments
        /yanglib:yang-library/yanglib:module-set/yanglib:module.  This specifies the current semantic version
        of the associated module and revision in a given module-set.  The related submodule-version leaf is added at
        /yanglib:yang-library/yanglib:module-set/yanglib:module/yanglib:submodule to indicate the semantic version of
        a submodule.</t>
      <t>In order to satisfy the requirements 4.1 and 4.3 of <xref target="I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs"/> that deprecated and obsolete node presence and operation are easily and clearly
        known to clients, ietf-semver also augments the ietf-yang-library with two additional boolean leafs at
        /yanglib:yang-library/yanglib:module-set/yanglib:module.  A client can make one request of the ietf-yang-library and
        know whether or a not a module that has deprecated or obsolete has those nodes implemented by the server, as opposed to
        making multiple requests for each node in question.
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="deprecated-nodes-present :">A boolean that indicates whether or not this server implements deprecated nodes.
           The value of this leaf SHOULD be true; and if so, the server MUST implement nodes
           within this module as they are documented.  If specific deprecated nodes are not
           implemented as documented, then they MUST be listed as deviations.  This leaf defaults to true.</t>
          <t hangText="obsolete-nodes-present :">A boolean that indicates whether or not this server implements obsolete nodes.
           The value of this leaf SHOULD be false; and if so, the server MUST NOT implement
           nodes within this module. If this leaf is true, then all nodes in this module MUST
           be implemented as documented in the module.  Any variation of this MUST be listed as
           deviations.  This leaf defaults to false.</t>
         </list>
       </t>
       <t>
         If a module does not have any deprecated or obsolete nodes, the server SHOULD set the corresponding leaf above
         to true.  This is helpful to clients, such that if the MAJOR version number has not changed, and these booleans are
         true, then a client does not have to check the status of any node for the module.
       </t>
       <t>Module compatibility can be affected if values other than the default are used for the leafs described here.
         For example, if a server does
         not implemennt deprecated nodes, then a given module revision may be incompatible with a previous revision where
         the nodes were not deprecated.  When calculating backward compatibility, the default values of these
         leafs MUST be considered.  From a client's point of view, if two module revisions have the same MAJOR version
         but the run-time value of deprecated-nodes-present (as read from the ietf-yang-library) is false, then
         compatibility MUST NOT be assumed based on the module-version alone.</t>
  </section>

  <section title="Deprecated and Obsolete Reasons" anchor="deprecated_and_obsolete_reasons">
    <t>The ietf-semver module specifies an extension, status-description, that is designed to be used as
      a substatement of the status statement when the status is deprecated or obsolete.  The argument to
      this extension is freeform text that explains why the node was deprecated or made obsolete.  It may also
      point to other schema elements that take the place of the deprecated or obsolete node.  This text
      is designed for human consumption to aid in the migration away from nodes that will one day no longer work.
      These extensions address requirement 4.2 of <xref target="I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs"/>.

      <t>As explained in <xref target="implementation_experience"/>, while programatically determining a semantic version is possible
         using the pyang utility, human overisght is highly recommended because of some special cases which can not be detected by pyang.
         Therefore, a model author SHOULD use both means to determine a model's semantic version.</t>

      description
        "The version number for the module revision it is used in.
         This is expressed as a semantic version string in the form:
          x.y.z
         where:
          * x corresponds to the major version,
          * y corresponds to a minor version,
          * z corresponds to a patch version.

         A major version number of 0 indicates that this model is still
         in development, and is potentially subject to change.

         Following a release of major version 1, all modules will
         increment major revision number where backward incompatible
         changes to the model are made.

         The minor version is changed when features are added to the
         model that do not impact current clients use of the model.
         When major version is stepped, the minor version is reset to 0.

         The patch-level version is incremented when non-feature changes
         (such as bugfixes or clarifications to human-readable
         descriptions that do not impact model functionality) are made
         that maintain backward compatibility.
         When major or minor version is stepped, the patch-level is
         reset to 0.

         By comparing the module-version between two revisions of a
         given module, one can know if different revisions are backward
         compatible or not, as well as
         whether or not new features have been added to a newer revision.

         If a module contains this extension it indicates that for this
         module the updated status and update rules as this described in
         RFC XXXX are used.

         The statement MUST only be a substatement of the revision statement.
         Zero or one module-version statement is allowed per parent
         statement. NO substatements are allowed.

          exclusive (respectively).  If this is omitted, a full semantic version must be specified
          and the import will only support this one version.

         The following version, if specified with a '[' or '(' indicates the lower bound.  This can
          be a full semantic version or a MAJOR only or MAJOR.MINOR only.

         The '-', if specified, is a literal hyphen indicating a range will be specified.  If the second portion
          of the import-versions clause is omitted, then there is no upper bound on what will be considered
          an acceptable imported version.

         After the '-' the upper bound semantic version (or part thereof) follows.
         After the upper bound version, one of ']' or ')' MUST follow to indicate whether this limit is inclusive
          or exclusive of the upper bound respectively.

         Finally, a literal comma (',') MAY be specified with additional ranges.  Each range is taken as a logical
          OR.

    <t>
        There are a few requirements of
        <xref target="I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs"/> still to be addressed.  These include the following:
    </t>

    <t>
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>A solution is required for client compatibility to address requirements 3.1 and 3.2 from <xref target="I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs"/>.
        This could include adding "module sets" support to ietf-yang-library where the client can choose one set with which to use.</t>
        <t>A solution for instance data to satisfy requirement 5.3 of <xref target="I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs"/> is also required.</t>
        <t>While not mandatory, requirement 2.2 of <xref target="I-D.verdt-netmod-yang-versioning-reqs"/> looks to provide a way to determine,
        at the node level, whether or not changes have occurred between revisions of a given YANG module.  This may require application
        of semver at the node level.</t>
      </list>
    </t>
  </section>
  <section anchor="open_issues" title="Open Issues">
    <t>Additionally, there are a few open issues to be discussed and settled.  These include the following:</t>

    <t>
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Do we need a new version of YANG?
          <vspace/>
          While eventually this will fold into a new version, the belief is this solution can
          work with extensions alone with an update to the <xref target="RFC7950"/> text concerning
          module updates.</t>
        <t>Should IETF/IANA officially generate derived semantic versions for their own modules?
        As they are the owner of the modules it should be their responsibility, but how to document it?
		Note that next round of funding for the yangcatalog.org could help develop the perfect
		derived-semantic-version toolset
        </t>
        <t>We could consider a new naming convention for module files. Today, module files
          are named using a  module@revision.yang notation.  We could consider module%semver.yang
          or module#version.yang variants.
          Re-using the '@' for version is not ideal, so another separator character should be used.
          In this manner, both version and revision could be used.
