        This document describes the problems that can arise because of the YANG language module update rules, that require all updates to YANG module preserve strict backwards compatibility.  It also defines the requirements on any solution designed to solve the stated problems.  This document does not consider possible solutions, nor endorse any particular solution.

      <t>
        This requirements document initially considers some of the existing YANG module update rules, then describes the problems that arise due to those rules embracing strict backwards compatibility, and finally defines requirements on any solution that may be designed to solve these problems by providing an alternative YANG versioning strategy.
      </t>

    <section anchor="background" title="Background">
      <t>
        The YANG data modeling language
        <xref target="RFC7950"/>
        specifies strict rules for updating YANG modules (see section 11 "Updating a Module"). Citing a few of the relevant rules:

        <list style="numbers">
          <t>
            "As experience is gained with a module, it may be desirable to revise that module. However, changes to published modules are not allowed if they have any potential to cause interoperability problems between a client using an original specification and a server using an updated specification."
          </t>
          <t>"Note that definitions contained in a module are available to be imported by any other module and are referenced in "import" statements via the module name. Thus, a module name MUST NOT be changed. Furthermore, the "namespace" statement MUST NOT be changed, since all XML elements are qualified by the namespace."
          </t>
          <t>"Otherwise, if the semantics of any previous definition are changed (i.e., if a non-editorial change is made to any definition other than those specifically allowed above), then this MUST be achieved by a new definition with a new identifier."
          </t>
          <t>
            "deprecated indicates an obsolete definition, but it permits new/continued implementation in order to foster interoperability with older/existing implementations."
          </t>
        </list>
        The rules described above, along with other similar rules, causes various problems, as described in the following sections:
      </t>
      <section anchor="slow_standardization" title="Striving for model perfection">
        <t>
          The points made above lead to the logical conclusion that the standardized YANG modules have to be perfect on day one (at least the structure and meaning), which in turn might explain why IETF YANG modules take so long to standardize.
          Shooting for perfection is obviously a noble goal, but if the perfect standard comes too late, it doesn't help the industry.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="some_YANG_modules_are_not_backward_compatible" title="Some YANG Modules Are Not Backwards-Compatible">
        <t>
          As we learn from our mistakes, we're going to face more and more non-backwards-compatible YANG modules. An example is the YANG data model for L3VPN service delivery
          <xref target="RFC8049"/>
, which, based on implementation experience, has been updated in a non-backwards-compatible way by
          <xref target="RFC8299"/>
.
        </t>
        <t>
          While Standards Development Organization (SDO) YANG modules are obviously better for the industry, we must recognize that many YANG modules are actually generated YANG modules (for example, from internal databases),
          which is sometimes the case for vendor modules
          <xref target="RFC8199"/>
. From time to time, the new YANG modules are not backwards-compatible.
        </t>
        <t>
          Old module parts that are no longer needed, no longer supported, or are not used by consumers need to be removed from modules. It is often hard to decide which parts are no longer needed/used; still the need and practice of removing old parts exist.
          While it is rare in standard modules it is more common in vendor YANG modules where the usage of modules is more controlled.
        </t>
        <t>
          The problems described in
          <xref target="clear_indication_of_node_support"/>
          may also result in incompatible changes.
        </t>
        <t>
          In such cases, it would be better to indicate how backwards-compatible a given YANG module actually is.
        </t>
        <t>As modules are sometimes updated in an incompatible way the current assumption that once a YANG module is defined all further revisions can be freely used as they are compatible is not valid.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Non-Backwards-Compatible Errors">
        <t>
          Sometimes small errors force us to make non-backwards-compatible updates. As an example imagine that we have a string with a complex pattern (e.g., an IP address). Let's assume the initial pattern incorrectly allows IP addresses to start with 355. In
          the next version this is corrected to disallow addresses starting with 355. Formally this is a non-backwards-compatible change as the value space of the string is decreased. In reality an IP address and the implementation behind it was never capable
          of handling an address starting with 355. So practically this is a backwards-compatible change, just like a correction of the description statement.  Current YANG rules are ambiguous as to whether non-backwards-compatible bug fixes are allowed without also requiring a module name change.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="No way to easily decide whether a change is Backwards-Compatible">
        <t>
          A management system, SDN controller, or any other user of a module should be capable of easily determining the compatibility between two module versions. Higher level logic for a network function, something that cannot be implemented in a purely
          model driven way, is always dependent on a specific version of the module. If the client finds that the module has been updated on the network node, it has to decide if it tries to handle it as it handled the previous version of the model or if it
          just stops, to avoid problems. To make this decision the client needs to know if the module was updated in a backwards-compatible way or not.
        </t>
        <t>
          This is not possible to decide today because of the following:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>It is sometimes necessary to change the semantic behavior of a data node, action or rpc while the YANG definition does not change (with the possible exception of the description statement). In such a case it is impossible to determine whether the change is
              backwards-compatible just by looking at the YANG statements. It's only the human model designer who can decide.</t>
            <t>Problems with the deprecated and obsolete status statement,
              <xref target="clear_indication_of_node_support"/>
            </t>
            <t>YANG module authors might decide to violate YANG 1.1 update rules for some of the reasons above.</t>
          </list>
          Finding status changes or violations of update rules need a line-by-line comparison of the old and new modules is a tedious task.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="No good way to specify which module revision to import">
        <t>
          If a module (MOD-A) is imported by another one (MOD-B) the importer may specify which revision must be imported. Even if MOD-A is updated in a backwards-compatible way not all revisions will be suitable, e.g., a new MOD-B might need the newest MOD-A.
          However, both specifying or omitting the revision date for import leads to problems.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the import by revision-date is specified
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              If corrections are made to MOD-A these would not have any effect as the importâ€™s revision date would still point to the un-corrected earlier YANG module revision.
            </t>
            <t>
              If MOD-A is updated in a backwards-compatible way because another importer (MOD-C) needs some functionality, the new MOD-A could be used by MOD-B, but specifying the exact import revision-date prevents this. This will force the implementers to
              import two different revisions of MOD-A, forcing them to maintain old MOD-A revisions unnecessarily.
            </t>
            <t>
              If multiple modules import different revisions of MOD-A the human user will need to understand the subtle differences between the different revisions. Small differences would easily lead to operator mistakes as the operator will rarely check the
              documentation.
            </t>
            <t>
              Tooling/SW is often not prepared to handle multiple revisions of the same YANG module.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          If the import revision-date is not specified
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              any revision of MOD-A may be used including unsuitable ones. Older revisions may be lacking functionality MOD-B needs. Newer MOD-A revisions may obsolete definitions used by MOD-B in which case these must not be used by MOD-B anymore.
            </t>
            <t>
              As it is not specified which revisions of MOD-A are suitable for MOD-B. The problem has to be solved on a case by case basis studying all the details of MOD-A and MOD-B which is considerable work.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Early Warning about Removal">
        <t>
          If a schema part is considered old/bad we need to be able to give advance warning that it will be removed. As this is an advance warning the part must still be present and usable in the current revision; however, it will be removed in one of the next
          revisions. The deprecated statement cannot be reliably used for this purpose both because deprecated nodes may not be implemented and also there is no mandate that text be provided explaining the deprecation.
        </t>
        <t>
          We need the advance warning to allow users of the module time to plan/execute migration away from the deprecated functionality. Deprecation should be accompanied by information whether the functionality will just disappear or that there is an
          alternative, possibly more advanced solution that should be used.
        </t>
        <t>
          Vendors use such warnings often, but the NMDA related redesign of IETF modules is also an example where it would be useful for IETF. As another example, see the usage of deprecated in the Java programming language.

      <section title="Clear Indication of Node Support" anchor="clear_indication_of_node_support">
        <t>
          The current definition of deprecated and obsolete in
          <xref target="RFC7950"/>
          (as quoted below) is problematic and should be corrected.
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>"deprecated" indicates an obsolete definition, but it permits new/continued implementation in order to foster interoperability with older/existing implementations.</t>

          </list>
        </t>
        <t>YANG is considered an interface contract between the server and the client. The current definitions of deprecated and obsolete mean that a schema node that is either deprecated or obsolete may or may not be implemented. The client has no way to
          find out which is the case except for by trying to write or read data at the leaf in question. This probing would need to be done for each separate data-node, which is not a trivial thing to do. This "may or may not" is unacceptable in a contract. In
          effect, this works as if there would be an if-feature statement on each deprecated schema node where the server does not advertise whether the feature is supported or not. Why is it not advertised?

  <section anchor="problems" title="The Problem Statement">
    <t>
      Considering the issues described in the background, the problem definition can be summarized as follows.
    </t>
    <t>
    Development of data models for a large collection of communication
   protocols and system components is difficult and typically only
   manageable with an iterative development process. Agile development
   approaches advocate evolutionary development, early delivery, and
   continual improvement. They are designed to support rapid and
   flexible response to change. Agile development has been found to be
   very successful in a world where the objects being modeled undergo
   constant changes.
    </t>
    <t>
   The current module versioning scheme relies on the fundamental idea
   that a definition, once published, never changes its semantics. As a
   consequence, if a new definition is needed with different
   non-backwards-compatible semantics, then a new definition must be
   created to replace the old definition. The advantage of this
   versioning scheme is that a definition identified by a module name
   and a path has fixed semantics that never change. (The details are a
   bit more nuanced but we simplify things here a bit in order to get
   the problems worked out clearly.)
    </t>
    <t>
   There are two main disadvantages of the current YANG versioning
   scheme:

      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Any non-backwards-compatible change of a definition requires
     either a new module name or a new path. This has been found costly
     to support in implementations, in particular on the client side.</t>
        <t>Since non-backwards-compatible changes require either a new module
     name or a new path, such changes will impact other modules that
     import definitions. In fact, with the current module versioning
     scheme other modules have to opt-in in order to use the new
     version. This essentially leads to a ripple effect where a
     non-backwards-compatible change of a core module causes updates on
     a potentially large number of dependent modules.</t>
      </list>
    </t>
    <t>
   Other problems experienced with the current YANG versioning scheme
   are the following:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>
   YANG has a mechanism to mark definitions deprecated but it leaves
     it open whether implementations are expected to implement
     deprecated definitions and there is no way (other than trial and
     error) for a client to find out whether deprecated definitions are
     supported by a given implementation.
        </t>
        <t> YANG does not have a robust mechanism to document which data
     definitions have changed and to provide guidance how
     implementations should deal with the change. While it is possible
     to have this described in general description statements, having
     these details embedded in general description statements does not
     make this information accessible to tools.
        </t>
        <t>
    YANG data models often do not exist in isolation and they interact
     with other software systems or data models that often do allow
     (controlled) non-backwards-compatible changes. In some cases, YANG
     models are mechanically derived from other data models that do allow
     (controlled) non-backwards-compatible changes. In such situations,
     a robust mapping to YANG requires to have version numbers exposed
     as part of the module name or a path definition, which has been
     found to be expensive on the client side (see above).
        </t>
      </list>
    </t>
    <t>
   Given the need to support agile development processes and the
   disadvantages and problems of the current YANG versioning scheme
   described above, it is necessary to develop requirements and
   solutions for a future YANG versioning scheme that better supports
   agile development processes, whilst retaining the ability for
   servers to handle clients using older versions of YANG modules.
